      The context for the status. Default is GithubActions - ${GITHUB_WORKFLOW}
    default: "GithubActions - ${{ github.workflow }}"
    required: true
  status:
    description: >
      Commit or job status, based on this the action will set the correct status in the commit:
      Accepted values are: 'error', 'failure', 'pending', 'success' and 'cancelled'.
      By default it will use the current job status.
      If the passed status is 'pending' it will set status commit 'pending'
      If the passed status is 'failure' or 'cancelled' it wil set status commit 'failure'
      If the passed status is 'success' it will set status commit 'success'
      If the passed status is 'error' it will set status commit 'error'
    default: "pending"
    required: true
  ignoreForks:
    description: >
      If the pull request is from a fork the action won't add a status by default.
      This is because the action won't have a token with permissions to add the status
      to the commit. You can disable this, but then you'll have to provide a token
      with enough permissions to add status to the commits in the forks!
      Will be used only for pull requests.
    default: "true"
    required: true
  addHoldComment:
    description: >
      If true the action will add a comment to the pull request. This is useful if you use prow and you get PRs from forks,
      you can use `/hold` and `/hold cancel` instead of the status check since the token won't have permissions to do that.
      Will be used only for pull requests.
    default: "false"
  pendingComment:
    description: >
      This is the message to add to the pull request when the status is pending.
      Will be used only for pull requests.
    default: "/hold"
  successComment:
    description: >
      This is the message to add to the pull request when the status is success.
      Will be used only for pull requests.
    default: "/hold cancel"
  failComment:
    description: >
      This is the message to add to the pull request when the status is 'failure', 'error' or 'cancelled'.
      Will be used only for pull requests.
