## Overview

A simple Github Action that allows us to update the status of a commit.

GitHub does not update the status of a commit when running workflow and therefore tools that rely on the context/status of a given commit are not compatible with it.

Currently the action supports `pull_request` and `push` events:
* When the event is `pull_request`, the action will set the status to the last commit in the pull request at the moment the workflow was triggered.
* When the event is `push`, the action will set the status to the last commit pushed at the moment the workflow was triggered.

## Input Parameters

* token: Auth token used to add status commits
  
  * required
  * default: "${ github.token }"
  
* name: The Name of the status check to add to the commit
  * required
  * default: "GithubActions - ${GITHUB_WORKFLOW}"
  
* status: Commit or job status, based on this the action will set the correct status in the commit: Accepted values are: `error`, `failure`, `pending`, `success` and `cancelled`.

  If the passed status is `pending` it will set status commit `pending`.

  If the passed status is `failure` or `cancelled` it will set status commit `failure`.

  If the passed status is `success` it will set status commit `success`.

  If the passed status is `error` it will set status commit `error`.

  * required
  * default: "pending"
  
* url: URL for the status check.

  * optional
  * default: ""

* description: Description for the status check.

  * optional
  * default: ""

* ignoreForks: If the pull request is from a fork the action won't add a status by default. This is because the action won't have a token with permissions to add the status to the commit. You can disable this, but then you'll have to provide a token with enough permissions to add status to the commits in the forks! __Will be used only for pull requests.__

  * optional
  * default: "true" 

* addHoldComment: If true the action will add a comment to the pull request. This is useful if you use prow, since prow won't detect the github actions, so you can use `/hold` and `/hold cancel` to avoid merging the PR before you want. __Important: this will be disabled for forks if `ignoreForks` is set to true, this is because the default github token won't have permissions to add comments if your PR comes from a fork. Will be used only for pull requests.__

  * optional
  * default: "false"

* pendingComment: This is the message to add to the pull request when the status is `pending`. __Will be used only for pull requests.__

  * optional
  * default: "/hold"

* successComment: This is the message to add to the pull request when the status is `success`. __Will be used only for pull requests.__

  * optional
  * default: "/hold cancel"

* failComment: This is the message to add to the pull request when the status is `failure`, `error` or `cancelled`.__Will be used only for pull requests.__

  * optional
  * default: "/hold"

## Integration with Prow

An example is [Prow](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow) which uses the Github Status API to read the status of a given commit. 
Using this actions you can tell tide to not skip optional contexts and effectively wait for a GitHub Workflow to pass before merging.

### Example with Tide

```
tide:
  context_options:
    # Treat unknown contexts as required
    skip-unknown-contexts: false
```

## Development

__Important: Before pushing your changes run `make release` to generate all the correct files and clean stuff, etc...__
